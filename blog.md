I just spent way too long making the little image for the home page on this post in figma. It was honestly a real pain in the ass. Overall super happy with the look though.

This blog inspiration was created from how I was just wanting to get something new out there, and also have it very easy to have something to write to.

From here I plan to create a seperate landing page that will link to this blog, and also create a seperate consulting business webpage.

This was a lot of work! Learning how to get Jekyll going with github pages was just a lot, but now we finally have that down. Hopefully there's not much more to learn, but we'll see.
